# aoc 2023
I am doing Advent of Code in 2023 in Go. I'll use `gotip`, because I want to play with new, unreleased features of 
future versions of Go. Namely, I'd love to try out their experimental range-over-func proposal, and range-over-int
may be interesting as well.

These solutions may run in an actual released version of Go in the future, but for now they must be run with `gotip`
and `GOEXPERIMENT=rangefunc`.
