# Advent of Code

This is my repo for solving the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) in Rust. Each year will have its own subfolder.

## aoc-dl

Also included is [`aoc-dl`](./aoc-dl/), a utility to download each puzzle's input and generate a starter template for a particular puzzle.

## common

`common` is a small set of utils for preparing puzzle input.
